# Data_analysis-on-MovieLens-20M--PySpark
The Movielens 20M dataset is a large-scale dataset containing user ratings and metadata for movies. In this project, we performed data analysis on the Movielens 20M dataset using PySpark, a powerful big data processing framework.

The analysis is performed using PySpark's distributed processing capabilities to efficiently handle large datasets. The study begins with data preprocessing, which involves cleaning, filtering, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis.Exploratory data analysis techniques are then used to gain insights into the dataset, such as identifying the most popular movies and genres, finding the most active users, and examining the distribution of ratings.

## Problem Statement :
The MovieLens 20M dataset contains movie ratings data from 20 million users. The dataset is too large to be processed on a single machine using traditional data analysis tools. Therefore, the goal of this project is to perform data analysis on the MovieLens 20M dataset using PySpark, a distributed computing framework for big data processing
